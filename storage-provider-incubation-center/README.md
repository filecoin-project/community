# Filecoin Storage Provider Incubation Center

 ## Foreword

 So far, there are about  [2700](http://filscan.io/) storage providers(miners) in the Filecoin Network，accounting for more than [7.5EiB](http://filscan.io) storage power. In the meantime, daily growth of storage power between [50-70PiB](http://filscan.io/), There is a lot of data that is now stored in the Filecoin network. We found most of the storage power is generated by storage providers in Asia, a few large storage providers contributed a larger percentage of storage power to the Filecoin network. For a better Filecoin network and resilient ecosystem, improving the storage power proportions from small and medium storage providers are essential. But due to the cost of investment, software and hardware configuration, and the rapid growth of the Filecoin network, it's not easy to maintain a proper Lucky Value to earn proper reward with providing storage power to the whole network. In the meantime, the slower growth of storage power by small & medium storage providers also reflects the current Filecoin network needs to be strengthened to better support the small medium storage providers.

 ## What is Filecoin Storage Provider Incubation Center?

 ### The progress of Venus

 Venus team have supported a distributed storage pool(mining pool) on Filecoin network based on Implementation-[Venus](https://venus.filecoin.io). Small and medium storage providers friendly from a distributed mining pool can be seen in different aspects, including but not limited to:

 1. Venus implementation consists of shared and independent modules which is cost-effective to bring down the overall cost of hardware maintenance and save the time usage when mining on Filecoin network. Thus, it can bring more storage providers to the Filecoin network with lower barriers to entry.

 2. Through independent module ([venus-sealer](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-sealer), [venus-wallet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-wallet), etc) management, it's convenient and simple for small storage providers to manage a single or a few nodes within this system.

 3. With the block generation power/right gathered, storage providers can combine their resources together, in another way, to prevent the situation like no message can be packed for small storage providers.

 4. Stable rewards to small storage provider from a distributed mining pool is possible, there are multiple plans under design through a better reward distribution mechanism.

 ### Filecoin Storage Provider Incubation Center

 Storage Provider Incubation Center provides a series of free services to small storage providers by Venus team supported by resources from shared modules，operation and maintenance, technical consultancy, the reason to do so is to make it simple and convenient for small storage providers to join this network with lower cost and lower barrier to store massdata on the Filecoin Network. 

 #### There are 2 tracks in this program:

 - Track1: Filecoin Storage Provider Incubation Center Program aims to bring more small storage providers to the Filecoin network with the financial support from Filecoin Foundation and technical support from Venus Team. 
 - Track2: Venus Master Fellowship Program is a sub-project of Filecoin storage provider Incubation Center, which aims to incubate teams or individuals capable of providing service of Filecoin distributed mining pool service based on Venus to improve the productivity of storage providers and the fault tolerance of the Filecoin network.

 ### What do this program provide

 Venus team made it possible through [Venus Distributed Ming Pool Architecture](https://venus.filecoin.io/guide/) the incubation center will keep running shared modules like [venus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus), [venus-auth](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-auth), [venus-messager](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-messager), [venus-miner](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-miner), [venus-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs-force-community/venus-gateway)，**storage providers can just run with** [venus-sealer](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-sealer), [venus-wallet](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus-wallet) and make sure to connect with distributed mining pool then can run with one or a few nodes at the same time.

 There may be some issues with joining the incubation center, but we have a Venus team and Venus Masters to support you to do so.

 Due to the different situation with storage providers, the time and resources required varies too. We do welcome all storage providers who are interested in the incubation center to read all the rules and check about the requirements first.
