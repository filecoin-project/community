**Background**  
This poll is to gather the community's sentiment on [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md). Discussions about this FIP can be carried out in the original [FIP issue #56](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/issues/56).

**Proposal**  
Allow the Maximum Lifetime of V1 Proof Sectors to be 540 Days

**Impact**  
Please see [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/issues/56#issuecomment-804841505) for a report from [Blockscience](https://github.com/BlockScience) on the impact of accepting versus rejecting this FIP. The report includes a summary of the background context, when these sectors will be expiring, and what the projected impact of their expiration would be on the storage power and sector collateral.

**Outcome**  
Core implementers will make a final decision on whether the FIP should be accepted in the network based on the poll result and a final security audit.
