# Welcome to Filecoin Storage Provider-Bounty Board! 

The Filecoin Storage Provider Bounty Board focuses on development, specification, and implementation of priorities from Filecoinâ€™s storage provider community. This is a similar initiative to the [IPFS bounty board](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/BOUNTIES.md) but focused on storage providers. Throughout this project, we aim to improve our ecosystem and community support by working with community members and contributors. Our program is intended to motivate more contributors to participate in the Filecoin project and to solve open issues by rewarding ongoing & existing contributors that add significant value to Filecoin. 

## Issues

To propose an issue, please [raise them here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues). To ensure issues are correctly addressed as soon as possible by the Filecoin ecosystem team, please try to make sure that you describe your suggestion in as much detail as possible. 

## Bounties

Bounties are monetary awards for completing eligible issues in the Filecoin Storage Provider Bounty Board. Please leave a comment within the issue requesting to be assigned to that issue before submitting a pull request. This minimizes the chance of multiple different contributors duplicating work by submitting a pull request for the same issue. If you submit a pull request to an issue without first being assigned to it, that pull request may not be accepted. Once the pull request is merged, you can claim the bounty.
