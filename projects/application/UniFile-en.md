## Project Description

An open source storage system for your data that storage in Filecoin/IPFS use [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage) which makes it easy to share them anywhere on the web.

UniFile is tightly scoped for the present and more broadly thought out for the future. Our primary objective is to create a best-in-class experience for uploading, collecting, and sharing media.

In the future, we will adopt a decentralized incentive mechanism to encourage users to upload and use UniFile, and obtain a certain amount of Token income. And give Token more and more functions, such as decentralized governance, payment and other functions.

## Project Status

After a short period of development, the project has an initial demo, and is now applying for funding.
