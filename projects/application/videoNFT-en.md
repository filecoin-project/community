## Project Description
VideoNFT is the first platform specifically designed for creating and trading Video NFTs and lets anyone deploy a marketplace to create and trade VideoNFTs on VideoCoin + Filecoin blockchains. The software is open-sourced with a permissive license (dual-licensed under Apache and MIT as permitted) and any company, or individual can create their own marketplace or integrate the NFT functionality into their products or build advanced video applications using the NFT platform.

Filecoin is used for:
* Storing and retrieving the media files
* Storing, retrieving, and establishing the NFTâ€™s Proof of Ownership

VideoCoin is used for:
* Establishing and verifying NFT Proof of Ownership
* Implementing token contracts, providing standard ERC-721 and ERC-1155 interfaces
* Encode, re-encode and manage video assets by creating thumbnails, mobile-optimized videos, and create gifs
* Act as a layer-2 solution to bridge VideoCoin, Filecoin, and Ethereum and provide a low gas cost transaction engine
