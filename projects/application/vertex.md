## Project Name: Vertex
Vertex (formerly Rare Volumes)

## Category 
Marketplace

## Project Description
An augmented reality NFT marketplace built on top of Rarible protocol to elevate 3D art to first class citizenship. Currently there are no AR NFT platforms. This is the first attempt to build something, and to build it smartly on top of an already existing marketplace. Also, the nature of 3D/AR may allow for composability in the future via ERC998.
