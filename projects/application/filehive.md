## Project Description
Data is the lifeblood of the Internet and therefore one of the most valuable digital assets that can be exchanged. Filehive is a new kind of marketplace built on top of Filecoin and IPFS to provide everyone across the planet an easy and cheap way to distribute and consume diverse datasets.

The OB1 team has been working with Protocol Labs for many years now and this is the first Filecoin first project to come out of their development shop.
