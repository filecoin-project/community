## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->

With Capture App, photos, which we coin as ‘Captures’, become information containers. Multi-layered and traceable, Captures contain ownership & context as well as sealed blockchain record. To keep data decentralized, the assets are stored to FileCoin to ensure accessibility.

With Capture App, ownership and context are established the moment a photo is taken. 

The information is sealed on the blockchain and in just a few seconds, your photos are protected and ready to monetize.

## Team Info
<!-- Introduce your amazing team - how many team members are working on this project and who are they?-->
Numbers Protocol is a Taiwan startup founded in May 2019. We created a data integrity framework using blockchain and decentralized web to Capture, Seal and Trace data.

At Numbers Protocol, our ultimate goal is to create an Authentic Media Network where everyone can create secure and authentic digital assets. We do this with our protocol and Capture technology that leverages the latest metadata standards, blockchain and decentralized storage to secure digital assets (such as photos) at the origin.

Today, we are tackling the data provenance issue and rampant infringement in the photo industry.  We are doing so with our mobile application: Capture App and CaptureClub marketplace.
