TanSheepNFT is a platform for anybody to adopt their Tan Sheep and exchange their Tan Sheep via NFT.
* IPFS and Filecoin. We will use ipfs to store DNA codes, photos and videos of Tan Sheep. And users can use filecoin to buy TanSheepNFT.

* DNA and Photo recognition technology. As we know it is a very difficult problem to connect on chain hash and off chain objects, We use both DNA and photo recognition technology to distinguish Tan Sheep.
