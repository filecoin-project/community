## Project Description

TanSheepNFT is a platform for anybody to adopt their Tan Sheep and exchange their Tan Sheep via NFT.
* Neo smart contract. We will use Neo blockchain to develop and deploy our smart contract to manage Tan Sheep tokens
* IPFS and Filecoin. We will use ipfs to store DNA codes, photo and videos of Tan Sheep. And use filecoin to buy TanSheepNFT.
* DNA and Photo recognition technology. As we know it is a very difficult problem to connect on chain hash and off chain objects. We use both DNA an photo recognition technology to distinguish Tan Sheep.
* Poverty alleviation in northwestern China. As we know food has significant weight in people's lives in China. In the meaning time Tan sheep is a special kind of sheep from northwestern China which is very delicious and popular all around the whole country. Connecting Filecoin and Tan Sheep can shows our community's society responsibilties for people who lives in unpleasant environments and share benefits from blockchain and Filecoin with them.
