# Project Description
Everything on the IPFS or Filecoin network is public and anyone can access it within *cid*. **PriStorage** provides users a simple solution for storing files on the decentralized network. This application is similar to Google Drive but using IPFS/Filecoin as a cloud storage system and everything related to user management and data sharing based on NEAR smart contracts. Therefore, this application is fully decentralized, different from traditional centralized file storage applications and no one or organization can touch your files without permission.
