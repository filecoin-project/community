## Project Description
[pinitforward.xyz](https://pinitforward.xyz/) is a fully browser based application to locally pin all NFT assets from a wallet (collection and creations). Currently most NFT marketplaces rely on centralized IPFS pinning services like Infura or Pi√±ata to host the assets of their tokens. This application is meant to complement the existing storage of NFT marketplaces by adding additional redundancy to speed up the performance/transfer speed of files as well as to increase their persistence.
