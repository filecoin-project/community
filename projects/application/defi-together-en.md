## Project Description

Defi Together allows groups of friends to invest in Defi and share the returns with no trust required. The project allows users to start a group, add friends and propose defi transactions. Group members deposit their funds into Gnosis Safe, a multi-signature ETH wallet, and the safe can make defi transactions on behalf of the group.

To faciliate making Defi investment decisions amongst the group members, there needs to be tools for them to communicate. E.g., investment idea proposals and feedback, polls, chats, etc. All these interactions will need to store their states in a storage layer. In addition, access to these tools and their states should only be given to the group members.

In order to provide the safe app and the safe owners with authorized access to decentralized storage, we will use Ceramic and implement the Safe DID Method [CIP-101](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-101/CIP-101.md).

To speed up development time, the initial implementation will be a Gnosis Safe App. A separate web app can be built at a later stage.
