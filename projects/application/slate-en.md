## Project Description
Slate is the first open source file storage application designed to encourage collaboration and research across a distributed network. It is a first step towards enabling a thriving network for data storage and transactions powered by IPFS, Filecoin and Textile that is open and usable for everyone. Our goal is to provide a meaningful story for every feature the protocol provides today and in the future. The Slate Project is the byproduct of a growing community of contributors from around the world.

Slate is tightly scoped for the present and more broadly thought out for the future. Our primary objective is to create a best-in-class experience for uploading, collecting, and sharing media. Additional filetypes will be supported, but our focus is to start with the pieces that apply to everyone and then dial into more specific formats.
