NFT creation tool

## Project Description
A silly platform for creating your own uniquely patterned egg. The user, or rather egg-mage, uploads an image file that then textures a 3D egg. If they would like to conjure their egg onto the Ethereum blockchain and world, they are guided to do so.

## Project Status
Hacked together for the hackathon, and now looking beyond into the eggverse.

## Target Audience
Anyone with some knowledge of Ethereum and NFTs. Ideally if the project can garner some funding it could be partially driven by giveaways or egg drop/hunts to allow for the general public to engage with the creation process. Most people are aware/interested in NFTs and everyone loves eggs, so it is pretty well suited for wide adoption. Part of the general goal of the project is to abstract enough of the nitty gritty to make blockchain more approachable and fun.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
I think a few people looked at it during the hackathon, but I haven't really marketed it since.
