## Project Description

Miner.Report is a project to collect analytics data from the Filecoin blockchain. It is also a collection of notebooks on ObservableHQ with interactive visualizations that use the data.

## Project Status

The project is live on [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/collection/@jimpick/miner-report), with continuously updating deal data (daily and hourly), miner power and storage asks. The core data pipeline, powered by [Apache Spark Structured Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html), [Textile Buckets](https://docs.textile.io/buckets/) and [Estuary](https://estuary.tech/), is running 24/7 publishing new data multiple times per hour. The project is in an ideal state for new data sources, reports and visualizations to be added.

## Target Audience

The reports and visualizations will be of use to anybody who wants to gain insight into the overall state of Filecoin's storage and retrieval markets.
The data will be useful for identifying miners who are a good match for a particular storage strategy. It will be possible to analyze how other people are using Filecoin to successfully store their data.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)

The project just launched. Hopefully, if people find value in it, they will click on the "like" button on ObservableHQ.
