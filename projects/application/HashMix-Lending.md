## Project Description

HashMix proposes a tokenization scheme suitable for arbitrary hash power, implements a set of universal decentralized cloud hash power trading, lending, and swapping protocols to solve hash power fraud, hash power oversold, over-simplified product design, and lack of liquidity and flexibility in the current market, enables the free redistribution of global hash power.

The HashMix project got support from some of the top investment institutes, including HashKey Capital, Fenbushi Capital, LongHash Ventures, GBV, Kenetic Capital, and so on.
