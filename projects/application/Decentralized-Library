## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Decentralized Library uses Web3 technology to log users in to read books, learn and earn. The decentralized Library is a project born to help increase knowledge. Students are no longer using the library as it used to be in the past. This project incentivizes students to read books and watch videos from their discipline. This implementation is a use case of NFT (ERC721) in solving educational needs. As we know that Education is one of the Millennium Development Goals, This project seeks to help students or users to learn through e-books, video books, and Live streaming learning. IPFS was used to store contents for the decentralized Library (pdf files for ebook and mp4 for video books)

### Plans
1. Store ebooks and video books on NFT.storage
2. Update smart contract for multiple instances of books
3. Add assets for more academic discipline or book categories
4. Add premium books
5. integrate quiz and reward system
6. Quiz generation
