## How to Contribute
First of all, we'd like to get some good ideas how we can make a active Dapp service on IPFS. Secondly, to be a DAO, decentralization is one of the most imporatant factors for us and it's main differentiation from other competitors. We'd like to get ideas and contributions from community about ideas that how DAO for this NFT marketplace can work well.
