## Category 
developer tooling

## Project Description
Flink is a data provider DAO aiming at provider Chainlink Oracle service for Filecoin Network. The implementation offered deal information on multi chains for users who want to store there data on Filecoin network.

Flink requires two components to work as a data provider:

    Data aggregator
    Chainlink external adapter
    Data DAO notary

Several blockchain scanner aggeragate the data to a unified data provider, the chainlink esternal adapter with the oracle smartcontracs broadcasting the proof to target blockchain networks. Data notaries will sign the transaction based the oracle data onchain information.The payment is triggered once the proof that it has been stored on the Filecoin network is relayed from Chainlink oracles.

## Team Info

Filswan provides a decentralized edge infrastructure marketplace and software that moves data storage and analysis as
close as necessary on Web 3.0.

We - FilSwan Canada participated in SR1, SR2, and cooperation with starling and pinata project. In slingshot 2 we
processed over 10,000 deals and over 500 offline deals, talked to 100 miners and actively working data transfer service
between Asia and North American users. Prior to working on Filecoin project, we were working on a decentrilized AI
computing platform which using smart contract for data/task transmission to different AI workers, we have in hand
experience of handling encryption and data pipeline.
