## Project Description
This is a toolbox project to facilitate miners to better participate in filecoin.

1.Redo sector tool

- As the sector file in the storage is damaged, the correct proof cannot be provided. At this time, the sector needs to be repackaged to provide the correct WindowsPost proof.

2.WindowsPost test tool

- Usually, as a miner, there is a need to check whether a sector or multiple sectors are correct. This tool can simulate the behavior of WindowsPost to determine whether the sector is correct.

3.Monitoring and alarm service

- Monitor and alarm the mining, so that filecoin miners can find problems in time, and at the same time, they can also get the tips of successfully mining the block.

## Project Status
fundraising/udender development

## Previews
1.Redo sector tool

- Redo of all sectors will be supported. CC sectors are easy, and sectors with data must have the original data.

2.WindowsPost test tool

- It will support one sector, multiple sectors, and sector tests of `deadline` and `partition`.

3.Monitoring and alarm service

- Monitor and alarm the mining situation, and post the alarm information to slack, which may support other platforms' alarms in the future.
