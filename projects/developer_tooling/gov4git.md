- community management

## Project Description

Gov4Git is an independent, decentralized protocol for managing open source collaboration. It addresses a slew of common frictions and inefficiencies in collaborative open-source projects, by enabling communities to:

- __prioritize issues__ in a transparent and fair community-driven manner,
- __relieve maintainers__ from being a bottleneck in triage,
- objectively __quantify individual contributions__ based on peer review mechanisms, and
- conduct __decision-making__ on contentious issues in an efficient, inclusive, open, and democratic way.

Gov4Git is an independent system that can be deployed on any git provider.
It is also deeply integrated with GitHub, and provides a seamless user experience — suitable for non-technical users — via a desktop app.

## Project Status

Launched first release publically. Deployed by a few trial users.
