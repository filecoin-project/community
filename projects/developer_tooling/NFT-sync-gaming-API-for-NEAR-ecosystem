## Project Name "NFT sync gaming API for NEAR ecosystem"

## Category 
Game Developer Tooling

## Project Description
We build on top of an unlockable content service for the NEAR nft ecosystem and will be launched by the end of march, you can see an alpha version at [this link](https://vault.varda.vision/).
The Vault project uses the web3.storage client to provide immutable DB for unlockable content, we wish to build a similar API for NFT gaming interactions enabling gaming projects to recognize NFT ownership without querying the NEAR RPC but relying on an immutable database updated by a subgraph.

## Project Status
Alpha version

## Previews
[Link to video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CUchyqfluWC-M45ndtFginWsznJF3cK7/view?usp=sharing) of alpha version UI (you can see the gaming API button on the unlockable upload modal window)

## Target Audience
Game Developers, which are gathered by a [NEAR DAO](https://app.astrodao.com/dao/human.sputnik-dao.near/proposals) I work in, we already have funded project that asked me for this funcionality.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
Game devs and NFT collectors

## Docs
Find the readme in the vault repo and [this repo](https://github.com/jilt/near-create-app-webpack5-bundle) built to be able to use the web3.storage client library with the default near-create-app react command, at the end of this funding period i'll be sure to mantain (for at least 1 year) a specific template for near-create-app with webpack5 and web3.storage component installed.
