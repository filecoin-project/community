### GitHub issues

If you find something puzzling or encounter a straight-up bug in any of our repositories, please file a well-scoped issue. The issue lists for our most active repositories are below:

- [`lotus`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues) ([contribution guide](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus#contribute))
- [`venus`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/venus/issues)
- [`specs-actors`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/issues)
- [`rust-ffi-proofs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-fil-proofs)
- [`specs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs/issues)

If a repo has a Contributing Guide, please read it before filing an issue!

### Security issues and disclosures

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The Filecoin protocol is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations. Though Filecoin is not yet production-ready, many people are already running nodes on their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) document found in this repo on how to best report findings and participate on the bug bounty program.

## Useful links

If you are new to the Filecoin Project, below are some helpful links for you to learn more about it:
- Official website: [https://filecoin.io](https://filecoin.io)  
- [Filecoin Specification](https://spec.filecoin.io): contains documents, code, models, and diagrams that constitute the specification of the Filecoin Protocol.
- [Filecoin Docs](https://docs.filecoin.io): offers all the necessary resources to learn about Filecoin, the software and the tools to contribute to the network, either as a user looking for storage, or as a miner providing it  

## Ecosystem Projects

If your project uses Filecoin, you're in the Filecoin ecosystem! We'd love to see all awesome projects that are built on top of the Filecoin ecosystem to be known and get used by the Filecoin community! 

### Showcase Your Project!

Following the steps below to submit your projects to be featured in this [repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/tree/master/projects):
- Create a project profile using the [project submission template](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/templates/project-submission-template.md). Name the file name after your project and fill in as much information as you can.  Use your project name as the file name so the community can find your project easily!
- Create a new discussion thread in this repository's [Discussions > Project Showcase](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/categories/project-showcase), titled `[Category] Project Name`(i.e: `[Application] Slate`). Add this link to the "How the community can engage" section. Use this thread to share your updates, and chat with users and potential users!
- Once the project profile is ready, create a [PR](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/pulls), prefix `[Project Submission]` in the title, and request a review from one of the [maintainers](#maintainers).
- Let the maintainer know if you want your [updates](#updates-and-newsletter) to be featured in [Filecoin newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/filecoin.io/subscribe) or not in the PR description!
- If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge the PR and voila, your project is now featured here!

### Updates and Newsletter

We'd encourage all projects featured in this repo to share all of your thrilling updates with the community! Start a new comment with header `Project Name Update/Newsletter - Date` (i.e `## Slate Update - Feb, 2021`) in your project discussion to share the exciting news with the community!

## Events

Add our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/6?cid=ZmlsZWNvaW4ub3JnX2o3bW1ldjI0ZzgwcmVsbzU2cHFtMWVsMWUwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) or follow issues in this repo to keep track of events (meetups, hackathons, etc.) hosted by the Filecoin Project and/or Protocol Labs.

### Community calls

Our community calls are venues for all Filecoin Project community members to meet each other, share demos of recent work, discuss open problems, and more. We expect these calls to be extremely respectful venues where all community members follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and treat each other (i) as they would like to be treated and (ii) as they would treat each other in real life.

All community calls are **open for anyone to join**. However, we recommend that you take a look at each call's agenda (which can be found on GitHub issues under the label [`agenda`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/labels/agenda)) to make sure the call will be a good use of your time. We do our best to group similar demos and other agenda items together in the same call so it is easier to choose calls that you would like to attend.

Furthermore, we hold different calls for different communities. If you are a third-party app developer or OSS contributor, you might be interested in attending our **monthly development community calls** that are geared towards topics that developers will find useful. We also hold occasional **mining community calls** that are geared towards the needs of Filecoin miners.

Feel free to attend whichever calls are interesting to you. All calls are recorded, and the recording will be posted online at this repo.

Learn more about:

- [Development Community Calls](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/dev-calls/dev-calls.md)
- [Mining Community Calls](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/mining-calls/mining-calls.md)

We will announce each upcoming community call by making announcements in our [chat channels](#chat) and [website](https://filecoin.io/build/#events).

### Filecoin Meetups

Filecoin meetups are a great way to meet and connect with other developers and miners in your community that are using and learning about Filecoin.
