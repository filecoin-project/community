## About

Welcome to the Filecoin community repository! You can treat this repo as your go-to for all meta, non-code discussions (in the [issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues)), documents used by multiple repositories (such as the Code of Conduct), and how to interact with the Filecoin project and other community members.

If you are interested in discussing code or protocol design, feel free to come talk to us on our [discussion forums](#community-forum), [chat channels](#chat), or in issues on our other [Filecoin project repos](https://github.com/filecoin-project).

## Discuss

The vast majority of the Filecoin Project conversations are held on:

- GitHub issues
- [The discussion forum](https://discuss.filecoin.io)
- Chat (on Matrix/Slack/IRC) (see [Chat](#chat) section below)

We tend to be pretty responsive during normal business hours, which vary according to our timezones (we have a fully distributed team).

We also push updates to the community via:

- Filecoin blog: [https://blog.filecoin.io](https://blog.filecoin.io)
- Twitter: [@Filecoin](https://twitter.com/Filecoin)
- WeChat ID: Filecoin-Official

Before posting to different communications channels, make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Community forum

[https://discuss.filecoin.io](https://discuss.filecoin.io)

When in doubt, please post here!

We love to hear what the community has to say, whether it is to:

- Ask a question
- Propose a new feature
- Share a new project you're working on
- Find collaborators for your own community project
- And whatever else! Honestly!

The discussion forum uses the same Code of Conduct as our other community channels. Please make sure to read this before posting.

### Chat

You can join the conversation on chat via Matrix, IRC, and Slack.

Our primary chat channels are bridged (automatically copied) across Matrix, IRC, and Slack:

- **Matrix:** The [Filecoin community](https://app.element.io/#/group/+filecoin:matrix.org) on Element (our preferred Matrix client)
- **Filecoin Project Slack:** Create an account or login with your existing account at [https://filecoin.io/slack](https://filecoin.io/slack)
- **IRC:** [Coming soon](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues/4)

Note that you can generally think of the above options as interchangeable. Note, however, that some channels may not be bridged across chat spaces.

### GitHub issues

If you find something puzzling or encounter a straight-up bug in any of our repositories, please file a well-scoped issue. The issue lists for our most active repositories are below:

- [`go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/issues)
- [`rust-proofs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-proofs/issues)
- [`specs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs/issues)

If a repo has a Contributing Guide, please read it before filing an issue!

### Security issues and disclosures

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The Filecoin protocol is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations. Though Filecoin is not yet production-ready, many people are already running nodes on their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) document found in this repo on how to best report findings and participate on the bug bounty program.

## Events

Add our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/6?cid=ZmlsZWNvaW4ub3JnX2o3bW1ldjI0ZzgwcmVsbzU2cHFtMWVsMWUwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) or follow issues in this repo to keep track of events (meetups, hackathons, etc.) hosted by the Filecoin Project and/or Protocol Labs.

### Community calls

Our community calls are venues for all Filecoin Project community members to meet each other, share demos of recent work, discuss open problems, and more. We expect these calls to be extremely respectful venues where all community members follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and treat each other (i) as they would like to be treated and (ii) as they would treat each other in real life.

All community calls are **open for anyone to join**. However, we recommend that you take a look at each call's agenda (which can be found on GitHub issues under the label [`agenda`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/labels/agenda)) to make sure the call will be a good use of your time. We do our best to group similar demos and other agenda items together in the same call so it is easier to choose calls that you would like to attend.

Furthermore, we hold different calls for different communities. If you are a third-party app developer or OSS contributor, you might be interested in attending our **monthly development community calls** that are geared towards topics that developers will find useful. We also hold occasional **mining community calls** that are geared towards the needs of Filecoin miners.

Feel free to attend whichever calls are interesting to you. All calls are recorded, and the recording will be posted online at this repo.

Learn more about:

- [Development Community Calls](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/dev-calls/dev-calls.md)
- [Mining Community Calls](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/community-calls/mining-calls/mining-calls.md)

We will announce each upcoming community call by making announcements in our [chat channels](#chat) and [website](https://filecoin.io/build/#events).

### Filecoin Meetups

Filecoin meetups are a great way to meet and connect with other developers and miners in your community that are using and learning about Filecoin.

- Attend a Filecoin meetup (Coming soon)
- Organize a Filecoin meetup (Coming soon)

## Contributing

### Contributing Guidelines

We use a common [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) across all of our repos.

Each repo should have its own contributing guid
e, called `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Here is an example [Contributing Guide for `go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Filecoin Shipyard

[Filecoin Shipyard](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard) is a home we created for projects built by the Filecoin community. We encourage you to take a look around to explore some early projects incubated by the Filecoin community! If you're building something new on top of Filecoin, feel free to request to to add your project to the Shipyard!
